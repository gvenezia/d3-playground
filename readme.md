# D3 Playground

This repo provides a simple setup for exploring the D3 library. Currently, I'm working with a simple line graph. 

## How to use
Everything you need to start working with D3 is included in this repo: a codebase, data, and a simple server.

To set up the repo, simply clone the repo in your desired folder, then do an `npm install` to install dependencies. When you are ready to fire up your local server, simply type `http-server` on the command line.

Everything is availabe in the index.html file for editing. No need to filter through lots of files! (of course, in bigger projects modularity will be useful!)

## What kind of server does it use?
I use the npm package, `http-server`, to set up a simple local server.

## Resources used
This simple line graph is written with d3.js v4 and based on @mbostock's example [here](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/02d893e3486c70c4475f). 

This simple graph is designed to be used as a starting point for further development as part of documenting an update to the book [D3 Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4) to version 4 of d3.js.

Here are some screenshots of the basic setup and modifications that I've made:
